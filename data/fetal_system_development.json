    "detailed_process_explanation": "Neural tube closure occurs through primary neurulation - the neural folds elevate and meet at the dorsal midline, fusing in a zipper-like fashion. This begins at the cervical region and proceeds both cranially and caudally. The anterior neuropore closes around day 25, the posterior by day 28. Cells at the fusion point undergo epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, creating neural crest cells that will form peripheral nerves.",
    "father_understanding_note": "Imagine rolling a piece of paper into a tube and sealing the seam - except this seam must be perfect because it protects all the 'wiring' for your baby's entire nervous system. Missing the window is like forgetting to insulate wires before closing the walls.",
    "clinical_significance": "Failed closure causes neural tube defects: anencephaly (anterior failure, incompatible with life), spina bifida (posterior failure, varying disability), or encephalocele (skull defect). Maternal diabetes, obesity, hyperthermia, and certain medications increase risk."

The heart forms so early because growing tissues need circulation for oxygen and nutrient delivery.",
